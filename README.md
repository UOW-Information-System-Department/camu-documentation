  - `UG-L1-LECT`, `UG-L1-TUT1`, `UG-L1-TUT2`

### 11. Setting Dates
- **Short Semester (MPU):**
  - Start Date = semester start
  - End Date = 6 weeks later
- **Long Semester (Core):**
  - Follow academic calendar
  - *Do not change End Date*

### 12. Student Enrollment View
- If timetable dates are correct, students can enroll smoothly.
- If timetable is missing or incorrect:
  - Enrollment will show an error due to clashes.
- For subjects with multiple tutorials:
  - Admin must set them up one by one (e.g., Tutorial 1 under Tutorial 1 section).
  - Multiple tutorials require multiple sections.
  - Students will see several sections and can choose accordingly.
- Some subjects (e.g., MPU, ENG) may have different class timelines:
  - These typically run for 6 weeks.
  - Core and elective subjects run for 14 weeks.
  - Example:
    - `KBEN 1033N`: 
      - Session 1: 17 Sept 2025 – 31 Oct 2025
      - Session 2: 25 Oct 2025 – 5 Dec 2025
- Section naming format:
  - `UG-S1-LECT` → Short Semester
  - `UG-L1-LECT` → Long/Main Semester
  - *(“S” = Short, “L” = Long)*
